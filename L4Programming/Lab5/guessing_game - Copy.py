def guessing_game():
    """
    This function implements a number guessing game where the user has to guess a randomly generated number between 0 and 10.

    The function performs the following steps:
    1. Generates a random number between 0 and 10 (inclusive) that the user needs to guess.
    2. Continuously prompts the user to enter their guess.
    3. Compares the user's guess with the generated number and provides feedback:
       - If the guess is correct, it prints a congratulatory message and exits the loop.
       - If the guess is too low, it informs the user that their guess is too low.
       - If the guess is too high, it informs the user that their guess is too high.
    4. Repeats this process until the user correctly guesses the number.

    Example:
    -------
    If the generated number is 42 and the user guesses 35, the function will output:
    'Your guess of 35 is too low!'

    If the user then guesses 45, the function will output:
    'Your guess of 45 is too high!'

    When the user eventually guesses 42, the function will output:
    'Right! The answer is 42' and terminate.
